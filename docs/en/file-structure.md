# File sructure

All file structure is generated by command gulp init. You do not need to create something by yourself.

Builder has the following file structure:

```
├── gulpfile.js             # gulpfile of builder
├── tars-config.js          # Config file
├── package.json            # Basic dependencies
├── user-package.json       # User dependencies
└── tars/                   # Tasks and helpers for gulp
    └── helpers/            # Helpers
    └── tasks/              # Sustem tasks
    └── user-tasks/         # User's tasks
    └── watchers/           # System watchers
    └── user-watchers/      # User's watchers
└── markup/                 # The main project folder
    └── modules/            # Modules
    └── pages/              # Page's templates
    └── static/             # Static-files (css, js and so on)
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```


## The structure of the individual module

Module is an independent unit on the page. Example module - «header» or «footer». Each page consists of modules. Any module may include other modules.

```
exampleModule/                              # Module example
    └── assets/                             # Static files for current module (files with any extension) Subdirectories unsupport
    └── ie/                                 # Stylies for IE9.scss|less|styl и IE8.scss|less|styl)
    └── data/                               # Folder for module's data
        ├── data.js                         # Data for module (there is an example for data in _template module)
    ├── exampleModule.html                  # Handlebars-represent of module (it could be jade)
    ├── exampleModule.scss|less|styl        # Scss-represent of module (less|styl)
    ├── exampleModule.js                    # Js-represent

```

The basic idea is to make the module as much as possible isolated structure. You can use the [BEM](https://ru.bem.info), [web components](http://webcomponents.org) (and their [realization from Google](https://www.polymer-project.org)), something else. You can do everything by old-fashioned way, all markup is in one module, but it is not recommended.  If we talk by BEM terms, each module is a block. There is an [excellent lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyAYbbDJjPo) on how to better organize your code.

In the `pages` are page templates. Pages are layouts and should contain as little as possible code to the structure was as transparent as possible. To create a new page just copy the existing (or _template) and rename it.


## Folder static for structure

We assume that Scss was chosen as a css-preprocessor.

```
static/                                     #  Folder for static-files. You can choose the name for that folder in tars-config.js
    └── fonts/                              # Fonts (can contain subdirectories)
    └── img/                                # Images. You can choose the name for that folder in tars-config.js
        └── content/                        # Images for content (can contain subdirectories)
        └── plugins/                        # Images for plugins (can contain subdirectories)
        └── general/                        # General images for project (can contain subdirectories)
        └── sprite/                         # Raster images, which is included in png-sprite.
            └── 96dpi/                      # Images for displays with dpi 96
            ...
            └── 384dpi/                     # Images for displays with dpi 384 (more info in images-processing)
        └── svg/                            # SVG-images
    └── js/                                 # js
        └── framework/                      # js-frameworks (backbone, for example)
        └── libraries/                      # js-libraries (jquery, for-example)
        └── plugins/                        # js-plugins
        └── separate-js/                    # js-files, which must not be included in ready bundle
    └── misc/                               # General files, which will be moved to root directory of ready project — favicons, robots.txt and so on  (can contain subdirectories)
    └── scss                  
        └── etc/                            # Styles, which will be included in the end of ready css-file (can contain subdirectories)
        └── libraries/                      # Styles for libraries (can contain subdirectories)
        └── plugins/                        # Styles for plugins (can contain subdirectories)
        └── sprite-generator-templates/     # Templates for sprite generating
        └── sprites-scss                    # Mixins for sprites
        ├── common.scss                     # General stylies
        ├── fonts.scss                      # Stylies for fons
        ├── GUI.scss                        # Stylies for GUI elements (inputs, buttons and so on)
        ├── mixins.scss                     # Project's mixins
        ├── normalize.scss                  # Stylies reset
        ├── vars.scss                       # Variables
```


## The structure of the ready build

After assembly of the project in the root will be two folders: dev and builds. There are description the dev-version of the build (with enabled mode --ie8). The finished build is not much different from the dev.

```
dev/
    └── static/                         # Folder for static-files. You can choose the name for that folder in tars-config.js
        └── css/                        # Ready stylies and stylies for IE9 и IE8, if support is turned on
        └── img/                        # Images for project
            └── assets/                 # Static files for modules.
                └── exampleModule/      
            └── content/                # Images for content
            └── plugins/                # Images for plugins
            └── svg-sprite/             # SVG-sprite
            └── png-sprite/             # PNG-sprite for different dpi
            └── rastered-svg-images/    # Raster svg-images for IE8
        └── js/                         # Ready main.js and separate js-files
            └── separate-js/   
    └── temp/                           # Temp folder for modules' data
    ├── Ready pages and misc-files
```

build-version of the project does not contain a temp folder, includes minimized css- and js-files. It contains optimized pictures and archive with assembled project (optional).

If the option useBuildVersioning is enabled, each build will be in a separate folder on the path that is specified in the option [buildPath](options.md#buildpath), called build_ver%build_date% (or so, as you can set up in tars/helpers/set-build-version.js). If useBuildVersioning disabled, the finished project is in the path that is specified in the option buildPath, in folder 'build'.

When you need to include the image you have to use the path in which they are situated in the build.

Immediately after initialization or reinitialization in the root folder can be appeared .tmpPreproc and .tmpTemplater folders, which contain a downloaded template and css-preprocessor. At the first building these folders will be deleted. So just do not pay attention to them. These folders are included in .gitignore, so that they do not exactly get into your repository.

This file structure can be changed with the appropriate corrections of tasks and watchers. For some folders do not need to climb in tasks and watchers. For example, it is possible to create a folder for storing js, which must be included before and after the modules. This will be useful for using different js-frameworks.

Also, do not necessarily use all the folders for images or js. If something is not necessary, it can be removed.
